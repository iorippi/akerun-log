For the reference (I'm sorry but) check the source code.

## Caching feature

It will automatically set maximum API request interval allowed in accordance to the number of unique instance called within document and `max_apireq_permin` option. Cache will be stored in both per-session and to the file (which path is configured by `AKERUNLOG_CACHE_DIR` and `AKERUNLOG_CACHE_FILENAME`).

## Upcoming features

- 日本語で書く
	- 変換面倒くさいので誰かやってくれ

- Multiple instances
	- This is possible already, though it isn't tested, and there's more than just one line that has to be fixed before putting onto test.
	- Function for making it easier to handle. (Probably no one needs but..)

- Saving Daily logs (version 2?)
	- Currently this doesn't really support caching on daily basis, but instead it only keeps the newest cache for the last 24 hours by default.
	- Maybe Cache in the all past days if it doesn't exist. (First visit on site since days after the last visit may take a while, also error prone for exceeding max-request for API.)

- Error handling
	- Currently I couldn't test API request over 50/sec, so this app still doesn't know how to handle them on failure
	- Log message truncating (Half way built `exec_err_log`, but this isn't really tested yet)
	- Currently this could just stop and mess your document if it fails.

Tested on:
PHP Version
	- 5.5.27
	- 5.6.32
